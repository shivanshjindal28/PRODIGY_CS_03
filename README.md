# PRODIGY_CS_03
Created a Password Complexity Checker using Python language: Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provided feedback to users on the password's strength.<br>

After running the script, you will be prompted to enter a password.<br>
Enter a password and press Enter.<br>
The script will display the password strength and provide feedback on how to improve the password.<br>

Example output:<br>
Enter a password to check its complexity: Passw0rd!<br>
Password Strength: Strong<br>
Your password is strong.<br>
